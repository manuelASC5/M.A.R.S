                    "When i first created M.A.R.S me and my close friend Manuel were unsure of how to 
                    market this idea and gain memebers. Because people genually dont care about how 
                    there pollution affects the enviormet which is why its a problem in the first 
                    place. But by combining both fun and learning while also taking care of our oceans.
                    we made M.A.R.S more then an attempt to preserve our oceans, we made a community a 
                    place where people can feel both safe as well as a important part of our growing 
                    family."

                 Manuel "Manny" Najera:
                 "Being apart of M.A.R.S is a big deal to me. I have a lot of friends that give back to our Community 
                 and I wanted to do the same.Travis and I were shock by how our beaches and oceans were being treated and we wanted to change that.
                 I want people to join M.A.R.S because it's important to take care of our environment.With the help of more people we can make a change. 
                 Each day we clean our beaches and oceans our enviormet becomes way better."
