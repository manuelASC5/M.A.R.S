                During our trip to hawaii we stumbled upon a green turtle struggling to
                get a plastic ring from off of its neck, as tourist we were astonished 
                hawaii is known as one of the world's most beautiful, nature friendly 
                places of all time has animals that were not safe from our pollution, 
                it open our eyes as we saw the extent of pollution can do. From that 
                day forward we decided to devote ourselves to improving the environment 
                as much as we could.
